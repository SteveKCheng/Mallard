/// <para>
/// This type is similar to <see cref="HandleRefCount" /> but enforces that there can be at most
/// one thread that accesses a resource.  This functionality could be implemented with a standard
/// "lock" object in .NET but this type has the following additional features:
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item>
///     <para>
///     If a second thread attempts to enter the barricade, the code outright throws an exception
///     instead of waiting (possibly for a long time) until the first thread is done.  This behavior 
///     helps to identify programming errors, when the object should not be used from multiple threads 
///     in the first place.
///     </para>
///   </item>
///   <item>
///     <para>
///     A thread is disallowed by default to enter the barricade twice, unlike locks in C# which are 
///     always re-entrant.  Many designs are better off disallowing recursive locks and this library is no
///     exception.  Re-entrancy requires opt-in to help prevent logic bugs.
///     </para>
///   </item>
///   <item>
///     <para>
///     This type also tracks disposal: entering the barricade fails if the object being protected
///     has already been disposed.
///     </para>    
///   </item>
///   <item>
///     <para>
///     When some thread successfully enters a barricade, a managed reference to the object being
///     protected is kept so that it cannot be inadvertently finalized by the garbage collector
///     running in another thread.  Thus manual calls to <see cref="GC.KeepAlive(object?)" />

/// This type can be used to implement wrappers around resources from a native library that are
/// <em>not</em> thread-safe, <em>and</em> and should not be used
