/// Asymmetric lock that is optimized for objects that are mostly read from one thread, but

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// In particular, this construct is used to mediate access of native resources which are mostly
/// immutable, and accessed by only one thread at a time, typically for reading.
/// While a truly immutable object would automatically be thread-safe and would not need any locking
/// at all,  there may be occasional operations like disposal (destruction of the native resource) which
/// are not thread-safe and must be protected by a lock.  Then even read-only operations have to
/// follow the same locking protocol which can be undesirable for performance.  
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Ordinarily speaking, locks (or reference counts, as implemented by
/// <see cref="HandleRefCount" />) are not slow when uncontended, and are sufficient for most
/// purposes.  However, in this library we have workloads like reading from a data table with many cells,
/// where a safe API (without using "ref structs") requires locking for reading every individual cell,
/// yet reading a cell should be cheap if not for the locks
/// (because the cells are simple scalar values), all the while when the data table is not supposed to be
/// accessed concurrently anyway (because the data is presented in a streaming manner).
/// The locking serves no real purpose except to prevent run-time memory corruption if the user misuses
/// the API.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// In the context of this restricted scenario, <see cref="AsymmetricLock" /> implements
/// the optimization of avoiding any synchronization when the same thread keeps re-locking.
/// Specifically, ordinary locks minimally require at least one "interlocked" instruction
/// and  <see cref="AsymmetricLock" /> tries to avoid even that.
/// The optimization is worth doing when the number of CPU cycles taken by the interlocked operation
/// dominates that taken by the real work (like reading a scalar value off a native
/// memory buffer).  
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The costs of uncontended interlocked instructions probably come from the implied memory barrier â€” 
/// e.g. on the x86 architecture, all memory reads afterwards, even of unrelated local variables,
/// get delayed until all memory writes from the CPU's store buffer up to and including the
/// interlocked operation complete (Store-Load re-ordering is prohibited).
/// But this is exactly what can be avoided if only one thread is locking
/// the object.  The trade-off is that passing ownership of the object between threads, i.e. different
/// threads locking the object one after another, becomes more costly than in ordinary locks.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// In .NET that can always happen, silently, if the object is used in asynchronous code
/// (run on the thread pool), so it must be transparently
/// dealt with (without any explicit API calls from the user to relinquish thread affinity).  But such
/// situations should happen seldomly, compared to the number of times locks have to be taken in
/// order to read many cells off a data table.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Very similar optimizations are used in implementations of user-space RCU (Read-Copy-Update;
/// a concurrency paradigm to avoid CPU cache-line contention for objects that are mostly read,
/// and seldomly updated).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// If the native resource is immutable except for its destruction, it is theoretically possible
/// to disallow explicit disposal and rely solely on the .NET garbage collector to run finalizers.
/// Then all locks can be avoided entirely, but then memory usage can become wildly inefficient if
/// many heavy native resources are created.  So, it may be said that <see cref="AsymmetricLock" />
/// tries to get back close to the levels of performance that can be attained by ignoring memory/resource
/// lifetime management completely.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// As in RCU, it is theoretically possible to extend the optimization technique used here
/// to allow multiple concurrent reader threads, but that is quite more complicated to implement,
/// and, fortunately, such is not needed in this library.

/// the controlled object (the object that needs locking) be thread-safe (in its public API).
